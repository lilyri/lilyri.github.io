              <p>Working as a team for a single purpose, we achieve greater effects and results. To clarify when working in a team we are able to communicate frequently on how to approach our set end goal. As well as being able to check in with one another on their progress regularly. Even to have more impactful progress day by day as a team for the project. During this time we are able to share our skills, learn from each other. Overall it was an amazing experience, to create a great project with my teammates.

                  Service: Custom States Stamp <br>
                  Software: Illustrator, Photoshop</h6><br><br>
                  <p>For the team work section we chose to create a stamp that contains four different flowers, each representing a state of our choosing. In order to complete the stamp, we had regular scheduled zoom meetings, in order to determine the direction and set goals.<br><br>
                    As well communicated with each other via slack, for any adjustment and sharing our progress. We even assisted each other by introducing our own style and certain procedures when creating a design. Upon each draft we gathered feedback on how to improve our final stamp design. Overall I had an enjoyable time doing this project.
