              <h3 class="subheader">“Design is intelligence made visible.”</h3>
              <h5> - Alina Wheeler</h5><br>
              <p>Graphic design is a creative process to allow a designer to express their ideas with the combination of art and technology.  Logo, packaging, poster, magazines, shop signs, clothing patterns, advertisements…graphic design can now be found in all aspects of our lives. 
                When designing, I feel that communication and schedule management skills are very important to fully understand the client's needs and expectations from the beginning to complete the design and deliver it.<br><br>
                As a graphic designer, I need to challenge new things every day, so I can say that this job is stimulating and never gets boring.

                  <h6>Client: Mandalay, Myanmar<br>
                      Service: Tourism Logo Design<br>
                      Software: Adobe Illustrator</h6><br><br>
                  <p>This project was to create a tourism logo for Mandalay which is the 2nd biggest city in Myanmar. Bagan is an ancient city in the Mandalay Region. It was the capital of the Bagan Kingdom from the 9th to 13th centuries. The massive buddhist temples were built during the flourished Bagan dynasty.   <br><br>
                  It is very popular to get in a hot air balloon to view all the Buddhist ruins of Bagan. I chose the hot air balloon as a symbol of the city, using the color of orange to represent the monk’s robe and the beauty of sunset. Regarding the typography, I chose a sans-serif  Bold font to match the heaviness of its history.
